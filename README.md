This project is a simple Bash script that interacts with the GitHub REST API to list users who have access to a specific repository within an organization or user account.
It authenticates using your GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) and retrieves collaborators or contributors, displaying their GitHub usernames in a clean format.
